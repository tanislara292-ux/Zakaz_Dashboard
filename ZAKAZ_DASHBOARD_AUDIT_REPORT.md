# Zakaz_Dashboard – Full Test & Audit Report (2025‑10‑28)

## Environment Summary

- Repository is up to date with `origin/main`.
- Local workspace has read-only restrictions (no Docker Desktop available).
- Python 3.11+ accessible via `py`.

## 1. ClickHouse Schema Validation

| Command | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `python scripts/validate_clickhouse_schema.py` | ✅ | Passes after adding encoding fallback and deterministic partition checks |

### Key Findings
- Non-deterministic `PARTITION BY` clauses removed (`today()/now()` replaced with column-based expressions such as `_loaded_at`).
- Views now reference columns that exist in source tables.
- DDL files converted to UTF-8 to avoid encoding issues.

## 2. DDL Smoke Checks (ClickHouse)

- `dashboard-mvp/scripts/bootstrap_clickhouse.sh` cannot be executed end-to-end in the current environment because Docker Desktop is not running.
- `.env` derived from `.env.example` validates configuration paths.
- ClickHouse-specific fixes:
  - Added `_loaded_at`/`currency` columns with `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS ...`.
  - `stg_qtickets_sheets_inventory` now partitions by `_loaded_at` instead of `today()`.

## 3. Python Tooling & Tests

| Command | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `python -m compileall dashboard-mvp` | ✅ | No syntax errors |
| `cd dashboard-mvp/vk-python && python -m pytest` | ✅ | 3 tests passed |
| Integration tests (root) | ⚠️ | Expected failures: ClickHouse/Google Sheets services unavailable |

## 4. Docker Validation

- `docker --version` → 28.3.2 (installed).
- `docker compose version` → v2.39.1-desktop.1.
- Full `docker build` blocked by inactive Docker Desktop (environment limitation, not repository issue).
- Dockerfile for `integrations/qtickets_api` follows best practices (Python 3.11-slim, non-root user, cached pip installs).

## 5. CI/CD Recommendations

Mandatory jobs:
- `python scripts/validate_clickhouse_schema.py`
- `python -m compileall dashboard-mvp`
- `cd dashboard-mvp/vk-python && python -m pytest`
- `docker build --no-cache -f dashboard-mvp/integrations/qtickets_api/Dockerfile ...`
- Optional (recommended): smoke run `smoke_qtickets_dryrun.sh` against a CI provisioned ClickHouse.

Developer checklist (before commit/push):
- Run the validator, compileall, pytest, and a dry-run Docker build.
- Ensure smoke test succeeds when ClickHouse is available.

## 6. Follow-up Actions

1. Enable Docker Desktop (or CI ClickHouse service) to execute `bootstrap_clickhouse.sh` and smoke tests automatically.
2. Keep DDL comments in English to avoid encoding ambiguity (repository now stores UTF-8 only).
3. Add `.env` templates for integration tests (`dashboard-mvp/test_env/.env.template` committed).
4. Integrate the validator and smoke run into CI once infrastructure is ready.

## Overall Assessment

- ✅ Static analysis, Python compilation, unit tests, and Dockerfile review completed.
- ⚠️ Infrastructure-dependent checks (ClickHouse bootstrap/smoke, container build) pending due to environment limits.
- Repository now contains scripts/templates to support automated validation once CI services are aligned.
